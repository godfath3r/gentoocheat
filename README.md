Gentoo Cheatsheet  
-----------------

When I get to use Gentoo after a long penguin-pause-period I find myself swimming through 
  * bash_history
  * my scripts folder
  * my brain cells
  * respectable amount of googling time
  * the list goes on...

to remember those neat tools/commands (ok, not so neat) I used to use to make my life simpler and my gentoo system more up-to-date, more stable, smooth...

So it'll be very usefull to keep a short list like a cheatsheet so I can recall things easily.

You're free to copy/use the list any way you want, and send some feedback.
