Gentoo Cheatsheet  

When I get to use Gentoo after a long penguin-pause-period I find myself swimming through bash_history/My brain cells/Custom Script/"the list goes on". So it'll be very usefull to keep a short list like a cheatsheet so I can recall things easily.

You're free to copy/use the list any way you want, and send some feedback.
